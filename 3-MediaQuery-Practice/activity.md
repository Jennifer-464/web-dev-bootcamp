## Overview

### The activity

This activity was more of a practice. It was to learn about responsive design and how that's done through media queries.

## My Process

### What I learned

I was already familiar with media queries, but in the example given, the navigation bar was styled with only 3 properties. I learned that by default, the display value of a bullet point is list-item. Giving ul & li the values of display: inline overrides the default display value of bullet points and therefore the bullet points will disappear. A much easier way of setting up the navigation bar.
