## Overview

### The activity

In this project, I completed a pricing panel through the mobile-first approach. These can be seen in many sites such as Kahoot or API sites offering their services with 1 being the featured, recommended, or most commonly used one.

Users should be able to:
- [X] See mobile version
- [X] See desktop version
