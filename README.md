# Summary - Web Development Bootcamp

Hai there :blush: 

My name is Jennifer with intermediate knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Starting May 2023, I've been completing a [2023 Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). After completing a [21 hour YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys) I've been completing challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/). With this new bootcamp, I hope to refresh my knowledge in:

- CSS Frameworks
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- AJAX, CRUD & MERN

I currently work at a non-profit organization teaching the basics of front-end developing to a cohort of youth for a year. I help them understand how to navigate Figma as well to extract media and generally understand how to read it. This has helped me get deeper understanding, but I am looking to expand my knoweldge and take on more challenging projects. My goal is to become an experienced Front-End Developer to pursue a career in this field ü§ç üôå
